# DesktopApps

This is my collection of desktop applications I have made.

## Folder structure

How to run these programs:

Since almost everything will be made in Visual Studio, to run to exe you must first:

1. Download the zip

2. Open up the folder of the program you want to run. 

3. Find the "obj" folder, then the "Release" folder, and afterwards running the application.

4.  If you need any help, please issue me a report. In the future I am going to make it much easier to find it.
